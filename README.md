# Titanic-10-model-tuning-ensembling-first-n-automatically
 Using titanic data predicts survival probabilities of the passengers through model tuning and ensembling
 Just you need to input how many models you want to ensemble out of 10 classificiation models. It ensemble the best n models according to their cross validation accuracies and give sumbission file for the probabilities by using the tuned and ensembled models.
