# Titanic-10-model-tuning-ensembling-first-n-automatically
 Using titanic data predicts survival probabilities of the passengers through model tuning and ensembling.Just you need to input how many models you want to ensemble out of 10 classificiation models given below. It ensemble the best n models according to their cross validation accuracies for the validation set and give sumbission file for the probabilities by using the tuned and ensembled models.
